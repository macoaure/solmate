Here’s a specification for commit instructions based on the [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) standard. This specification provides guidelines for developers to write consistent, meaningful, and emoji-enhanced commit messages.

---

## **Gitmoji Commit Instruction Specification**

### **Objective**
Standardize commit messages using emojis to improve readability and communication of changes in the repository.

---

### **Commit Message Structure**

A commit message must follow the format:
```
<emoji> <short description> (optional scope)
```

**Rules:**
1. Begin the commit message with the relevant Gitmoji emoji.
2. Write a concise, present-tense description of the change.
3. Optionally, include the scope in parentheses after the emoji (e.g., `✨ (UI)`).
